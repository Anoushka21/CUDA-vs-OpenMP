# CUDA-vs-OpenMP
As deep learning models have grown in complexity and size, the need for accelerated and high-performance computing is paramount. With the choice of multiple languages and frameworks, it is necessary for each developer to discern what is the optimal choicefor their specific requirements. <br>
In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of CUDA and OpenMP on the basis of:
- Programmability
- Scalability
- Performanceand Overheads <br>
### Algorithms discussed:
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Convolution Operation
- Bellman-Ford
- N-Queens and
- Kmeans Clustering

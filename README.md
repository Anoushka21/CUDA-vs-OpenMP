# CUDA-vs-OpenMP
As deep learning models have grown in complexityand size, the need for accelerated and high-performancecomputing is paramount. Most cloud services rely heavily onthe parallel processing ability of the Graphics Processing Unitfor computationally heavy workloads. In the last two decades,NVIDIA-developed CUDA has served as the foundation of GPU programming and is the most widely adopted language.However, in the last few years languages like OpenMP andOpenCL have also started supporting GPU offloading. With thechoice of multiple languages and frameworks, it is necessaryfor each developer to discern what is the optimal choicefor their specific requirements. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of CUDA and OpenMPon the basis of their programmability, scalability, performanceand overheads for five diverse and varied algorithms: Sieve ofEratosthenes, Convolution Operation, Bellman-Ford, N-Queensand Kmeans Clustering.
